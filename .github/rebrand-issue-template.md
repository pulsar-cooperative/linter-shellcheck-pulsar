title: Rebrand this Repository
labels: good first issue
---
This repository may or may not contain items that still need to be rebranded after having been forked.
This may include but is not limited to:

  * `README.md`
  * `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  * `package.json`
  * `./keymaps/`
  * `./menus/`
  * `./lib/`

It's most important to rebrand any items that are keymaps, menu items, or appear in the `package.json`. But of course it's important to ensure the entire package has been rebranded to the new package name, as well as replacing Atom with Pulsar where applicable.
