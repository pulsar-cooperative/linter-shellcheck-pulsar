<!-- Pulsar Cooperative Package Repository Template, place at the start of the original CONTRIBUTING document -->

To learn how to contribute to any repository within the Pulsar Cooperative Organization, ensure to read the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/pulsar-cooperative/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the org.
Otherwise, below is the original contributing documentation for this repository. This information has not been updated or modified from how the original developers had written it, so if there is any conflicting information between this document and the organization wide contributing document, the organization wide document should **always** take precedence, and be regarded as the source of truth for how to contribute.

Thanks for taking the time to contribute and make Pulsar Cooperative, truly a Cooperative effort!
